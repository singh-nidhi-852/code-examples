Headless wordpress is basically use to store the data only,Can not use it in frontend to show the data. It contains same , wordpress,php,mysql at top and not rendring any content through wordpress and simply use WP to store the data.
The data can be passed to mobile or web Apps using rest API or GraphQL.
For Frontend can be used as react JS, Vue JS, Angular , You can use GatsByJS to render the content statically.
Can use react native to make phone app.
Can be publish same content to n number of platfiorm like internal site, CRM phone app or any other places.
Can use component libraries to share code from site to site , site to app and so on...




So As per my understanding , I need to write down an code which will replace all the old image code with your provided new code by using any hook , instead of going on each place and changes , correct?
